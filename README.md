# Assignment 2

**Remember to put your name at the top of your file.**

A convenient algorithm for determining the date of Easter in a given year was devised in 1876 and first appeared in Butcherâ€™s Ecclesiastical Handbook. This algorithm holds for any year in the Gregorian calendar, which means years including and after 1583. Subject to minor adaptations, the algorithm is as follows:

1. Let y be the year (such as 1583 or 2003).
2. Divide y by 19 and call the remainder a. Ignore the quotient.
3. Divide y by 100 and get a quotient b and a remainder c.
4. Divide b by 4 and get a quotient d and a remainder e.
5. Divide b + 8 by 25 and get a quotient f. Ignore the remainder.
6. Divide b - f + 1 by 3 and get a quotient g. Ignore the remainder.
7. Divide 19 \* a + b - d - g + 15 by 30 and get a remainder h. Ignore the quotient.
8. Divide c by 4 and get a quotient i and a remainder k.
9. Divide 32 + 2 \* e + 2 \* i - h - k by 7 and get a remainder r. Ignore the quotient.
10. Divide a + 11 \* h + 22 \* r by 451 and get a quotient m. Ignore the remainder.
11. Divide h + r - 7 \* m + 114 by 31 and get a quotient n and a remainder p.

The month is n and the day is p+1

**Write a program to solve for the day that Easter falls on for a given year.**

**Your program should have a variable for the desired year, display the values for all of the variables,
and output the date for Easter.**

**Your code will be graded on both functionality and proper style (indentation, variable names, readability, etc.).**

Here is a sample output for 2020.

```
a: 6

b: 20

c: 20

d: 5

e: 0

f: 1

g: 6

h: 18

i: 5

k: 0

r: 3

m: 0

n: 4

p: 11

Easter is on 4/12 in 2020
```

Verify that the program gives the correct date of Easter for the current year.
